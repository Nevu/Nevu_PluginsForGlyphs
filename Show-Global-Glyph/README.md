# Show Global Glyph

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays a Glyph called *_global* in the Background of other Glyphs. This can give an alternative to Global Guidelines.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `ShowNodeCount.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle Plugin from the view menu.
