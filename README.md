# Show Global Glyph

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the great [Glyphs Font Editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

It displays a Glyph called *_global* in the Background of other Glyphs. 
This can give an alternative to Global Guidelines.

### How to use

You have do add a glyph called *_global* and it will show in the background of each glyph when *View > Show Global Glyph* is turned on.
Now you can draw any form or stroke, and it will show behind every other glyph.

To show only strokes use a overlaid double path (see screenshot below). That gives you the choice between just lines and filled form.

Use *open contours* to draw *blue* fields (see screenshot below).

### Examples
